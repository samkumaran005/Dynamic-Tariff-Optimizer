<div class="about-section">
    <h2>What Are Time of Use Tariffs?</h2>
    <p>Time of Use (ToU) tariffs are pricing structures for electricity that vary based on the time of day. They offer lower rates during off-peak hours when electricity demand is lower, and higher rates during peak demand times when the grid is under stress.</p>
    
    <div class="tariff-explanation">
        <div class="tariff-type-card off-peak-card">
            <h3>🌙 Off-Peak Hours</h3>
            <p class="time-range">Midnight - 6:00 AM, 10:00 PM - Midnight</p>
            <p class="rate-info">Lowest rates (₹4.5 - ₹5.0 per kWh)</p>
            <p>Best time to run heavy appliances like washing machines, dishwashers, and EV chargers. Demand is lowest, often powered by renewable energy.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="tariff-type-card mid-peak-card">
            <h3>☀️ Mid-Peak Hours</h3>
            <p class="time-range">9:00 AM - 5:00 PM</p>
            <p class="rate-info">Moderate rates (₹6.0 per kWh)</p>
            <p>Reasonable time for medium-load appliances. Commercial demand is high, but residential usage can be optimized during these hours.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="tariff-type-card peak-card">
            <h3>⚡ Peak Hours</h3>
            <p class="time-range">6:00 AM - 9:00 AM, 5:00 PM - 10:00 PM</p>
            <p class="rate-info">Highest rates (₹8.0 - ₹9.0 per kWh)</p>
            <p>Avoid running high-power appliances. Everyone is using electricity - morning routines and evening activities create maximum grid stress.</p>

            <div class="icon">📊</div>
            <h3>Dynamic Pricing</h3>
            <p>Electricity prices change throughout the day based on demand. Higher demand = higher prices. Lower demand = lower prices.</p>

            <h3>Smart Meters</h3>
            <p>Smart meters track your exact usage in real-time and bill you according to when you used electricity, not just how much.</p>
